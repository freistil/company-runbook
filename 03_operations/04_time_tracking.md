### Time tracking

When you're in flow, it's easy to lose track of time. "Where did the last few
hours go?" And then, there are also days when we wonder "What exactly did I even
do today?" Especially when you're tackling a lot of small tasks, you might miss
  out on the sense of achievement at the end of a busy day. That's why we're
  using [RescueTime][rescuetime]. RescueTime is a service that
  helps you understand how you spend your time. It's built specifically for
  knowledge workers like us.

Your tracking data will be **exclusively visible to you**. Since we run a
Results-only Work Environment, we don't have the need to track work time as a
management tool.

In order to fully use RescueTime, simply sign up for an account and then upgrade
to RescueTime Pro on

(Ask your mentor for the actual sponsor code.) The subscription fee will
automatically be billed to the company.
