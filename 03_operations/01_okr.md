## Objectives and Key Results

>"Many people fail in life, not for lack of ability or brains or even courage,
>but simply because they have never organised their energies around a goal."  
>â€” Elbert Hubbard

Working towards a goal requires planning; that's common knowledge. But there will always be things that come in the way of working on your plan, especially in an IT business. That's why we needed to find ways of coordinating our work while still leaving enough space and freedom to deal with unplanned work and the unexpected things that come up in life.

In order to have a common way of defining and tracking results, we have adopted a practice called "Objectives and Key Results" (OKR). It works like this:

* For every quarter, we define objectives. They're the most important results we'd like to reach within the next three months.
* We define objectives for every level of the business: for the company as a whole, for our teams and for each individual.
* These objectives tend to be heavy, so three objectives on each level is usually enough.
* By breaking down the work for each objective into three to five key results, we clarify what needs to be done and define milestones that can be tracked over shorter intervals of time.

Let's take an example:

**Objective:** Replace our current data centre backup solution with a more
scalable one.

**Key results:**

1. Find three alternative solutions.
1. Compare their features, especially with regard to scalability, and assign scores.
1. Present your favourite alternative to the team.
1. Build a prototype of the new system.
1. Switch the new system into production and shut down the old system.

We challenge ourselves (and each other) to get out of our comfort zones, so we highly encourage setting stretch goals. It should mean a reasonable accomplishment if you reach 70% of what you've set out to do.

In your weekly 1-on-1 with your team lead, you'll discuss the progress towards your objectives. This is the place to take a critical look on what works for you and what doesn't.
