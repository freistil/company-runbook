## Communication

In a distributed team, the importance of communication can not be overstated.
Working together over a distance has its downsides, its most significant a lack
of information due to under-communication. That's why we encourage you to
over-share! That's why we encourage you to over-share!

_Make an effort to over-communicate. We can filter your stuff but we can't read
your mind._


### Chat

Most of our internal communication, in groups or 1:1, happens on [Slack][slack].
It works fine in a web browser but we recommend using the native application.


### Teleconferencing

We use [Skype][skype] for face-to-face conversations and team discussions.


### Group conversations

In our team, [Asana][asana] team conversations have replaced [Google
Groups][googlegroups] for written conversation between multiple people. If you'd
like to discuss a topic in a team or even company-wide, choose the appropriate
Asana team and click "Team Conversation" right below the team header in the
sidebar.


### Screen sharing

For workstation support and pair programming, [Screenhero][screenhero] is our
tool of choice. For internal or external presentations, we usually use
[Skype][skype].



### Email

External communication still happens mostly over email, and we use [Google
Mail][googlemail] and [Google Groups][googlegroups] here.

Please use the following email signature, at least in outbound messages:

```plain
freistil IT Ltd. | http://www.freistil.it
+353 1901 2642 | +49 761 45895590
freistil IT Ltd, 13 Upper Baggot Street, 2nd Floor, Dublin 4, D04 W7K5
Company number: 532004
VAT ID: IE3227412SH
```

We use [Google Groups][googlegroups] as shared mailboxes. There are these
different categories of groups:

* _Public inboxes_ for inbound email to certain business functions. They're simply
  named with their function, for example `jobs@freistil.it`. In most cases,
  these addresses forward email to our Help Center where they create a new
  support request ticket.
* _Team groups_ to address a whole team. They're named with "-team" added to the
  team name, for example `beancounter-team@freistil.it`. If you work with a
  certain team, you should join its group.
* _Bot groups_ for automated email. They're named with "-bot" added to the team
  name. The address `beancounter-bot@freistil.it`, for example, would be set up
  to receive notifications from accounting software and payment services. If you
  take care of services that send such notifications, you should join the
  corresponding bot group.
* _Archive groups_ for documentation purposes. If you're sending outbound email,
  you should always CC or BCC an archive group. They're named with "-archive"
  added to the team name, for example "beancounter-archive@freistil.it".


### Sharing results

In a Results-Only Work Environment, one of the most important things is
communicating your results to your team. With the help of
[IDoneThis][idonethis], you can easily share your progress, thoughts and
experiences. Simply add short entries to your work journal and they will be
included in the daily summary that IDoneThis sends to the team each morning.

There's a multitude of ways to add entries to your IDoneThis list:

* Enter your entries right on the [IDoneThis website][idonethis].
* Use the `/done` slash command in [Slack][slack] to add new entries to your
  journal. They'll automatically be posted to the \#done channel.
* Send an [email to IDoneThis](mailto:freistil-it-1@team.idonethis.com)
  and each line in the email body will be added as a separate journal entry.

If you have learned or built something that might even be of interest to other
professionals outside the company, consider writing an article about it on
our company blog!


### Choosing the right communication channel

Here we describe common situations and the most appropriate communication
channel(s) we use to resolve them. When in doubt, use common sense.

**I need to pass non-urgent information to one or more persons and get their
feedback**

* The best place for a short-term, synchronous discussion of a tactical nature
  is a [Slack][slack] channel.
* For topics that are more of a strategic nature and can be discussed
  asynchronously: Write a post to a team in [Asana][asana].
* Project management: Leave a comment in the relevant [Asana][asana]
  project/task.

**I need to pass non-urgent information to one or more persons and don't expect
feedback**

* Write down work results, ideas, concerns etc. in [IDoneThis][idonethis].
* Use [Google Docs][googledocs] to document an issue in a structured way.

**I need to preserve non-urgent email for later search**

* Send/forward the email to an archive group in [Google Groups][googlegroups].
  For maximum transparency, we recommend using these archive groups as a BCC
  recipient in all external email communication.

**I need to pass information to one or more persons and get their feedback
quickly, e.g. to be able to continue my current work**

Try these communication channels in order until you can establish a contact:
[voice/video call][skype], [Slack][slack] DM.

**I need to get support immediately, e.g. during incident management**

* Incident management: Create or escalate the incident in PagerDuty, write an
  "@channel" message in the \#incident channel on [Slack][slack].


### Town Hall meeting

Once a week, we have a [Skype][skype] call that everyone in the company is
expected to attend, our "Town Hall". This call has the purpose of getting the
whole team up-to-date with everything that's relevant:

* State of the business
* Important events
  * Changes to processes
  * Important customers we got or lost
  * Employee birthdays, anniversaries or other news
* Recent achievements

You can find the agenda for upcoming Town Halls on Asana and we encourage you to
add your own agenda items that you find relevant to the company. We encourage
everyone to also add relevant FYI items, e.g. plans for a longer vacation.


### Other meetings

Team discussions are expensive. They cost all participants time for preparation
and attendance, and they keep them from doing other work. That's why we have
these rules for team discussions:

1. Do we really need to talk? As an example, Dan McCarthy lists these
   [legitimate goals](http://www.greatleadershipbydan.com/2013/11/how-to-make-team-meetings-less-painful.html):
    * To solve problems, make decisions, or develop a plan
    * To make important, timely announcements
    * To share information that would be of interest to all team members
    * Team (or maybe individual) recognition
    * Learning
1. Who really needs to take part in this discussion?
1. Schedule a start, not an end – its over when its over, even if that's just 5
   minutes.
1. A team discussion invitation is only valid if it contains an agenda
   describing the milestones and goals of the talk.
1. Be on time!
1. No multi-tasking. No device usage unless it's really necessary.
1. Scheduled discussions are not for information sharing — that should be done
   before via email and/or agenda.
1. If you're not getting anything out of the discussion, leave.
1. Agree to action items, if there are any, at the conclusion of the discussion.
1. Don't feel bad about calling people out on any of the above; it's the right
   thing to do!


### Calendar

For scheduling appointments, we use [Google Calendar][googlecalendar].


### Task management

Each of us usually has a long list of open tasks.  [Asana][asana] helps us to
manage them.


### Customer support

We use [Zendesk][zendesk] to manage support requests from our customers.


### Time tracking

When you're in flow, it's easy to lose track of time. "Where did the last few
hours go?" And then, there are also days when we wonder "What exactly did I even
do today?" Especially when you're tackling a lot of small tasks, you might miss
  out on the sense of achievement at the end of a busy day. That's why we're
  using [RescueTime][rescuetime]. RescueTime is a service that
  helps you understand how you spend your time. It's built specifically for
  knowledge workers like us.

Your tracking data will be **exclusively visible to you**. Since we run a
Results-only Work Environment, we don't have the need to track work time as a
management tool.

In order to fully use RescueTime, simply sign up for an account and then upgrade
to RescueTime Pro on
[https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsor/SPONSORCODE](https://www.rescuetime.com/sponsor/SPONSORCODE).
(Ask your mentor for the actual sponsor code.) The subscription fee will
automatically be billed to the company.


### Documents and storage

For creating text documents and spreadsheets, we use [Google Docs][googledocs].


### Expenses

We refund you for all valid company expenses you paid out of your own pocket.
For certain kinds of expenses, we've defined limits; please check back with
Backoffice when in doubt.

You can file out-of-pocket expenses in your [FreeAgent account][freeagent]. For
each expense, please give a **precise description** including a date, e.g. "Taxi
to DrupalCamp venue, 2014-04-06".


### Invoices

Please make sure that invoices are addressed to

freistil IT Ltd  
13 Connawood Drive  
Bray, Co. Wicklow  
Ireland

In order to avoid VAT for expenses made outside of Ireland, give the vendor our
VAT ID "IE3227412SH". If they are an EU-based B2B vendor they should not charge
VAT; they will instead add a "Reverse Charge" clause (e.g. "Subject to reverse
charge in the country of receipt").


### Purchase requests

If you'd like the company to purchase something for you, please add it to the
"Purchase Requests" project in [Asana][asana].  After management approval, we'll
get it delivered right to you.

The following list contains our favourite vendors. You can speed up the approval
and purchasing process by adding the vendor's product ID (e.g. an Amazon ASIN)
to your purchase request.

* [Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk): computer hardware, office equipment
* [Spreadshirt](https://shop.spreadshirt.ie/freistilit): Branded clothing
