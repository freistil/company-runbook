## Your career at freistil IT

### Salary

We calculate salaries from a formula that takes the following aspects into
account:

* Base salary for the position (B)
* Seniority (S) — your skill level
* Success of the business (T) — we use last year's turnover as a proxy.
* Scope of responsibility (R) — this factor reflects how much you continuously contribute to our growth.

You can find our salary calculation sheet in the "Company" folder on [Google
Drive](/software/googledrive.html).


### Perks and benefits

#### Company library

At freistil IT, we're always learning. That's why we offer every team member a personal Kindle ebook reader with access to our company library. If you'd like to read a book that isn't yet in our Kindle library, simply order it. No matter what book it is, we'll get it for you.


#### Vacations

Instead of offering you a sick and vacation time allowance, we grant unlimited vacation time. You're flexible in taking time off and the company doesn't have to worry about counting accrued PTO.

We only ask you to follow these simple rules:

1. Give us as many work days advance notice as you'd like to take for your vacation. I.e., if you'd like to take 10 days off, please announce it at least 10 work days in advance. Simply add your planned vacation time to the "Events" calendar with the title "Vacation «NAME»".
2. Take at least 5 days off every quarter. Having an energetic team is essential and everyone needs some time away from work to recharge.


#### Coworking allowance

Because we want our employees to enjoy the benefits of remote work, we subsidise coworking with a monthly allowance of 150 €. Simply file an [expense](/operations/expenses.html) with your coworking invoice.


#### Conference subsidies

If you'd like to attend conferences that are not on our company events list already, we'll subsidise your registration fees with up to 100 € per month. We'd like to encourage you to be an active participant, for example by giving a presentation or Ignite talk or by organising a BoF.
