## Our Guiding Principles

As you can tell from our company name, we like to do things our own way.  At
freistil IT, "working freestyle" means:

* __We're self-funded.__ We haven't ever brought in outside financing. Since our
  earliest days this has been very important in providing freedom to shape the
  company and its business practices.
* __We're opinionated.__ We make our own decisions about how and with whom we do
  business. This has been essential for us to gain an enthusiastic customer base
  and a clear direction.
* __We work in a Results-Only Work Environment.__ We share the responsibility
  for the success of our company, and success comes from results that bring the
  business forward. In a ROWE, time spent in an office chair is not an
  adequate management metric. It's only the results that count.


### Our vision and values

Our long-term strategy is based on the V2MOM model created by Marc Benioff. In
his book ["Behind the Cloud"][behindthecloud], he talks about the planning
process he used at Salesforce.com to grow it into the largest SaaS company in
the world. It consists of the five elements "vision", "values", "methods",
"obstacles", and "metrics", short "V2MOM". The goal of V2MOM is to create
alignment from the CEO through to every front-line employee:

* Vision – The big picture idea
* Values – The main 3-5 driving values
* Methods – Specific tactics to achieve our goals
* Obstacles – Things that are working against our success
* Metrics – Key performance indicators for the right results

A key aspect of V2MOM is that we use this model on every level of the company,
beginning from a company-wide V2MOM down to the individual team member's V2MOM.

Here's our company-wide V2MOM. A V2MOM is never set in stone; it needs to
undergo regular reviews, so expect this section to change eventually.

**Vision**

1. Build a world-class Managed IT Services business for small and medium web
   agencies in Europe.
2. Build a team of experts that complement, inspire and advance each other.
3. Foster a company culture that values fun and creativity.


**Values**

1. __Freedom:__ We believe that treating our team members as responsible adults
   will yield the best results with the least friction and effort. That's why we
   chose the V2MOM approach over a set of rules in the first place: having basic
   values to guide our decisions gives every team and individual the freedom to
   find their individual way towards the company's vision. (For a company named
   "freistil IT", this should have been an obvious value, but it actually took a
   discussion at freistil Days in March 2015 to make it explicit.)
2. __Transparency:__ Transparency means that everyone (inside and outside the
   company) knows WHAT we do, HOW we do it and — most importantly — WHY we do
   it. Since transparency creates expectations in others, it fosters
   accountability.
3. __Quality:__ It is our vision of creating a world-class hosting business and
   we can only reach this goal by delivering top quality.
4. __Accountability:__ Everyone of us contributes to the company's success and
   we trust that everyone will strive to deliver high-quality results. This
   trust within a team, especially within a distributed team, can only grow in
   symbiosis with accountability. That's why we run the company as a
   Results-Only Work Environment (ROWE). Every team member is a business person
   who can make their own decisions. In order to achieve the best result, we
   expect every one to ask for as much advice as possible before making a
   decision.
5. __Community:__ We're building on the foundation of Open Source Software and
   we're an active part of that community. First of all, though, the company is
   our most important community — we're in this together and everyone is an
   integral part of it.

**Methods**

1. Develop the team.
2. Solve the DevOps problems of our customers.

**Obstacles**

1. Bootstrap financing limits our team growth.
2. Unclear priorities waste precious time.

**Metrics**

1. Recurring revenue
2. Team size


### We are a ROWE

The central concept in our approach to work is called "Results-Only Work
Environment", short ROWE. In many other companies, employees are expected get to
the office in the morning and stay there for about 8 hours. Apparently, this
even is important enough for them to put systems in place that tally work time
by the minute, and have managers make sure everyone follows the rules. We don't
care if you put in the necessary hours during daytime or at night, if you prefer
to work in bigger chunks of time or in many smaller ones. From our point of
view, time spent in the office is not a metric for productivity, and counting
butts in chairs is not a management task. Work is about achieving results and
helping employees in this is the best thing a manager can do. That's why the
talks with your manager will be mostly about the results you are going to
produce and how the company can support you with that.
