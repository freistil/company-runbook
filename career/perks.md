## Perks and benefits

### Ebook library

At freistil IT, we're always learning. That's why we offer every team member a personal Kindle ebook reader with access to our company library. If you'd like to read a book that isn't yet in our Kindle library, simply order it. No matter what book it is, we'll get it for you.


### Unlimited vacation days

Instead of offering you a sick and vacation time allowance, we grant unlimited vacation time. You're flexible in taking time off and the company doesn't have to worry about counting accrued PTO.

See ["Vacation planning"](/operations/vacation.html) for the details.


### Coworking allowance

Because we want our employees to enjoy the benefits of remote work, we subsidise coworking with a monthly allowance of 150 €. Simply file an [expense](/operations/expenses.html) with your coworking invoice.


### Conference subsidies

If you'd like to attend conferences that are not on our company events list already, we'll subsidise your registration fees with up to 100 € per month.

We encourage you to be an active participant, for example by giving a presentation or organising a BoF.
