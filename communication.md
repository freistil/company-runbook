## Communication

In a distributed team, the importance of communication can not be overstated. Working together over a distance has its downsides, its most significant a lack of information due to under-communication. That's why we encourage you to over-share! That's why we encourage you to over-share!

_Make an effort to over-communicate. We can filter your stuff but we can't read your mind._


### Chat

Most of our internal communication, in groups or 1:1, happens on [Slack](/software/slack.html).


### Teleconferencing

We use [Skype](/software/skype.html) for face-to-face conversations and team discussions.


### Group conversations

In our team, [Asana](/software/asana.html) team conversations have replaced [Google Groups](/software/googleapps.html) for written conversation between multiple people. If you'd like to discuss a topic in a team or even company-wide, choose the appropriate Asana team and click "Team Conversation" right below the team header in the sidebar.


### Screen sharing

For workstation support and pair programming, [Screenhero](/software/screenhero.html) is our tool of choice. For internal or external presentations, we usually use [Skype](/software/skype.html).



### Email

External communication still happens mostly over email, and we use [Google Mail](software/googleapps.html) and [Google Groups](software/googleapps.html).



### Sharing results

In a Results-Only Work Environment, one of the most important things is
communicating your results to your team. In the \#done channel on [Slack](/software/slack.html), you can easily share your progress, thoughts and
experiences. You can use DIRECT as a mnemonic for what you could write about:

* __Decisions:__ Did you make a choice that will affect others on the team?
* __Insights:__ Have you learned something new and interesting?
* __Results:__ Did you reach an important objective?
* __Emotions:__ Is there something that's making you happy? Sad?
* __Contacts:__ Did you get in touch with someone who could influence our business?
* __Troubles:__ Did you encounter an issue with which you could use some help?

If you have learned or built something that might also be of interest to customers or other professionals outside the company, consider writing an article about it on our company blog!


### Choosing the right communication channel

Here we describe common situations and the most appropriate communication
channel(s) we use to resolve them. When in doubt, use common sense.

**I need to pass non-urgent information to one or more persons and get their feedback.**

* The best place for a short-term, synchronous discussion of a tactical nature is a [Slack](/software/slack.html) channel.
* For topics that are more of a strategic nature and can be discussed asynchronously: Write a post to a team in [Asana](/software/asana.html).
* Project management: Leave a comment in the relevant [Asana](/software/asana.html) project/task.

**I need to pass non-urgent information to one or more persons and don't expect feedback.**

* Use [Google Docs](/software/googleapps.html) to detail an issue.

**I need to preserve non-urgent email for later search.**

* Send/forward the email to an archive group in [Google Groups](software/googleapps.html). For maximum transparency, we recommend using these archive groups as a BCC recipient in all external email communication.

**I need to pass information to one or more persons and get their feedback quickly, e.g. to be able to continue my current work.**

Try these communication channels in order until you can establish a contact:
[voice/video call](/software/skype.html), [Slack](/software/slack.html) DM.

**I need to get support immediately, e.g. during incident management.**

* Incident management: Create or escalate the incident in PagerDuty, write an "@channel" message in the \#incident channel on [Slack](/software/slack.html).


### Town Hall meeting

Once a week, we have a [Skype][skype] call that everyone in the company is expected to attend, our "Town Hall". This call has the purpose of getting the whole team up-to-date with everything that's relevant:

* State of the business
* Important events
  * Changes to processes
  * Important customers we got or lost
  * Employee birthdays, anniversaries or other news
* Recent achievements

You can find the agenda for upcoming Town Halls on Asana and we encourage you to add your own agenda items that you find relevant to the company. We encourage everyone to also add relevant FYI items, e.g. plans for a longer vacation.


### Other meetings

Team discussions are expensive. They cost all participants time for preparation
and attendance, and they keep them from doing other work. That's why we have
these rules for team discussions:

1. Do we really need to talk? As an example, Dan McCarthy lists these
   [legitimate goals](http://www.greatleadershipbydan.com/2013/11/how-to-make-team-meetings-less-painful.html):
    * To solve problems, make decisions, or develop a plan
    * To make important, timely announcements
    * To share information that would be of interest to all team members
    * Team (or maybe individual) recognition
    * Learning
1. Who really needs to take part in this discussion?
1. Schedule a start, not an end – its over when its over, even if that's just 5
   minutes.
1. A team discussion invitation is only valid if it contains an agenda
   describing the milestones and goals of the talk.
1. Be on time!
1. No multi-tasking. No device usage unless it's really necessary.
1. Scheduled discussions are not for information sharing — that should be done
   before via email and/or agenda.
1. If you're not getting anything out of the discussion, leave.
1. Agree to action items, if there are any, at the conclusion of the discussion.
1. Don't feel bad about calling people out on any of the above; it's the right
   thing to do!
