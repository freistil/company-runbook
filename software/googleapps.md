### Google Groups

We use Google Groups as shared mailboxes. There are these different categories of groups:

* _Public inboxes_ for inbound email to certain business functions. They're simply named with their function, for example `jobs@freistil.it`. In most cases, these addresses forward email to our Help Center where they create a new support request ticket.
* _Team groups_ to address a whole team. They're named with "-team" added to the team name, for example `beancounter-team@freistil.it`. If you work with a certain team, you should join its group.
* _Bot groups_ for automated email. They're named with "-bot" added to the team name. The address `beancounter-bot@freistil.it`, for example, would be set up to receive notifications from accounting software and payment services. If you take care of services that send such notifications, you should join the corresponding bot group.
* _Archive groups_ for documentation purposes. If you're sending outbound email, you should always CC or BCC an archive group. They're named with " archive" added to the team name, for example "beancounter-archive@freistil.it".
