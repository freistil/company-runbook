# Slack

Our team chat is on [https://freistil.slack.com](https://freistil.slack.com).

While Slack works fine in a web browser, we recommend installing the native application.

## Custom commands

Using Zapier, we've created a few custom commands to automate regular tasks.

\#ops channel:

* Create a task in the "Ops Documentation" project:  
`!writeup topic(Vim basics) description(Describe basic usage, especially how to quit it.)`

\#ops-oncall channel:

* Save a note to the "Ops On-Call" project:  
`!oncall title(Server x down for maintenance) description(Needs to have the Flux Compensator replaced.)`
