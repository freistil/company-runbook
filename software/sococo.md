# Sococo

[Sococo](https://www.sococo.com) is an unusual teleconferencing service that "recreates the personal proximity and functionality of a physical office in an online experience". In other words, it's an actual virtual office that visualises the presence of our team and allows audio and video calls in different "meeting rooms".


## Rooms

When we're not in one of the meeting rooms for a video call, we usually gather in "Coworking". This is where we put our avatars while we're working on our individual tasks. Starting calls in "Coworking" will disrupt the focus of everyone in the room and is therefore frowned upon.

Most of us use the "Lounge" to signal that we're taking a break. It's okay to start a casual chat here.


## Working with an "office window"

Enabling just the camera without the microphone while you're in "Coworking" achieves a similar effect as did Sqwiggle back in the day (which updated a still picture every few seconds). By allowing teammates a permanent view of your workplace, you make it perfectly transparent that you're at work. On the practical side, it also gives people a realistic expectation on how quickly you'll be able to answer a chat message or a call.

It's important to note that using Sococo this way is encouraged but completely up to each individual team member.
