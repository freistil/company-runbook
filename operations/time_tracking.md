# Time tracking

When you're in flow, it's easy to lose track of time. "Where did the last few hours go?"

And then, there are also days when we wonder "What exactly did I even do today?" Especially when you're tackling a lot of small tasks, you might miss out on the sense of achievement at the end of a busy day.

These are the reasons why we're using [RescueTime](/software/rescuetime.html). RescueTime is a service that helps you understand how you spend your time. It's built specifically for knowledge workers like us.

Your tracking data will be **exclusively visible to you**. Since we run a
Results-only Work Environment, we don't have the need to track work time as a management tool.
