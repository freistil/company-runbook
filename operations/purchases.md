# Purchase requests

If you'd like the company to purchase something for you, please add it to the "Purchase Requests" project in Asana. After management approval, we'll get it delivered right to you.

The following list contains our favourite vendors. You can speed up the approval and purchasing process by adding the vendor's product ID (e.g. an Amazon ASIN) to your purchase request.

* [Amazon](http://amazon.co.uk): computer hardware, office equipment
* [Spreadshirt](https://shop.spreadshirt.ie/freistilit): Branded clothing
