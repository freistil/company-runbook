# Task and project management

We manage our projects in [Asana](/software/asana.html).

## Launching a project

1. Create a Google Doc using the "Project Brief" template. The purpose of this
   document is to
  * describe its main goals
  * outline a SMART definition of "Done"
2. Create the Asana project
  * Put a link to the project brief into description field
3. Create Slack channel
  * Use `p-PROJECTNAME` as channel name


## Planning weekly WIP
