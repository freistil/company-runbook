# Task and project management

We manage our projects in [Asana](/software/asana.html).

## Scoping a project

In our experience, the agile approach works best in our IT operations work.
That's why we try to limit the scope of any project to the "minimum viable
result". There can always be a follow-up project that builds on what the current
one has achieved.

**As a guideline, a project should never take more than 6 weeks to finish
successfully.**


## Pitching a project

Create a Google Doc using the "Project Brief" template. The purpose of this
document is to give everyone a clear understanding of _why we should do the
project_ and how we're going to _finish it successfully_.

* Describe its main goals
* Outline a SMART definition of "Done"

When the document is finished, share a link to it and gather feedback.


## Approving a project

At the beginning of each month, the leadership team does an assessment if we
have capacity to take on a new project. If that's the case, they approve
projects in order of their strategic importance.


## Launching a project

Create a new Asana project, adding a link to the project brief into its
description field.

Create a new Slack channel for the project, using the `p-PROJECTNAME` naming
scheme.


## Breaking down work for a project

Starting at the high-level objectives from the project brief, break work down
into tasks of 1 work day or less.


## Facilitating progress for a project

Make sure there are always new tasks available that can be assigned during the
weekly WIP call.


## Finishing a project

Arrange a team review of the project where we share learnings and identify
potentional follow-up projects.

And promote the hell out of the finished result!
