### Expenses

We'll refund you for all valid company expenses you paid out of your own pocket. For certain kinds of expenses, we've defined limits; please check back with Backoffice when in doubt.

You can file out-of-pocket expenses in your [FreeAgent account][freeagent]. For each expense, please give a **precise description** including a date, e.g. "Taxi to DrupalCamp venue, 2014-04-06".
