# Customer support

## Chat

Effective DevOps processes that bridge the distance between our web operations team and the 
developer teams on the customer side are an important element of our value proposition and 
thus our business model. The definition of the [CAMS](http://devopsdictionary.com/wiki/CAMS 
"Culture-Automation-Measurement-Sharing") values of DevOps makes it clear that this requires 
lowering the barriers for communication and collaboration:

> "DevOps is mostly about breaking down barriers between teams. An enormous amount of time 
is wasted with tickets sitting in queues, or individuals writing handoff documentation for 
the person sitting right next to them. In pathological organizations it is unsafe to ask other 
people questions or to look for help outside of official channels. In healthy organizations, 
such behavior is rewarded and supported with inquiry into why existing processes fail."

That's why chat is an integral part of our tech support tools. While other IT service providers 
try to shield themselves from support requests behind web portals and ticket systems, we embrace 
the direct interaction between our engineers and the users of our managed services.

We use different services to provide support requests from our customers.

| Priority | Situation                                                | First response time |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Urgent   | Production application is completely down or unusable    | 30 minutes          |
| High     | Production application is up, but is negatively impacted | 4 hours             |
| Normal   | General support requests                                 | 1 business day      |
| Low      | Questions, requests and suggestions                      | 3 business days     |

Support requests received outside of our office hours are automatically
forwarded to an on-call support agent who gives you immediate feedback how we
are going to handle them.

With Chat integrated directly into the freistilbox Dashboard, customer communication is efficient 
and easy. It provides support agents with a simple interface that displays important customer details
right next to the message thread.

The synchronous nature of chat is a challenge, especially for a small support team which is at the 
same time responsible for running our IT infrastructure (after all, we're highly qualified web 
operations engineers, not just call center agents). Customers can (and will) reasonably expect 
swift response to their chat requests. Our chat solutions mitigates this challenge by setting realistic 
expectations and allowing a fallback to email. When a customer opens the chat dialog, they're presented
with the avatars of our most recently active team members and an estimate of how quickly we're likely 
to respond. In case the customer leaves the website before we're able to send a response, it will be 
emailed to them automatically; the thread can then be resumed via email or back in the chat interface.

During business hours, we aim at responding to a new request within 5 minutes.

To keep the conversation flowing, make sure to keep your attention on the message timeline. 
If your answer will be delayed by work on your part, let the customer know right away ("I'll go 
and check this and be right back.", "I'm sorry, something's come up â€”  is it okay if I'm off for a few minutes?")


## Support channels

### Conversation style

We encourage adding a human touch to our communication. We're neither robots nor corporate
lawyers, so let's not talk like them. ðŸ˜‰

Using emojis is an easy way to make a conversation more colloquial, and Intercom supports
this by enlarging emojis that are not accompanied by text. It's also perfectly fine to detour 
into social chat (e.g. "How's the weather over there?", "TGIF, right?") if the situation allows it.

After a case is finished, it is a good way to conclude with an offer to continue: "Is there 
anything else I can help you with?" This leaves the decision to end the conversation to the customer.

### Limitations

Not every issue can effectively be dealt with via chat. If for example a support case requires 
more detailed research or the involvement of other team members, creating a support ticket that 
can be answered more effectively at a later time shows respect for both our and the customer's time.

### Ticket system

See also: [Zendesk](/software/zendesk)

Tickets get created by sending email to info@, support@, backoffice@, hosting@ 
and using the support contact form in our dashboard.

Every ticket needs to be dispatched after 1 hours during business hours.
If it doesn't the oncall support engineer get a PagerDuty notification to
ensure this.

We tag tickets with the cluster and the website to make it easier to reference
the related system.

### Web chat

Intercom chat integrated into the [freistilbox Dashboard](https://dashboard.freistilbox.com)

For simple easy to resolve issues. Others get forwarded to our ticket system.
We get notified in Slack about incoming chat requests. Additionally the 
oncall support engineer gets a PagerDuty notification during business hours.

If a request is not handled, the chat system sets up email replies so the 
conversation can be handled asynchronously as well.
