## Support channels

### Ticket system

See also: [Zendesk](/software/zendesk)

Tickets get created by sending email to info@, support@, backoffice@, hosting@ 
and using the support contact form in our dashboard.

Every ticket needs to be dispatched after 1 hours during business hours.
If it doesn't the oncall support engineer get a PagerDuty notification to
ensure this.

We tag tickets with the cluster and the website to make it easier to reference
the related system.

### Web chat

Intercom chat integrated into the [freistilbox Dashboard](https://dashboard.freistilbox.com)

For simple easy to resolve issues. Others get forwarded to our ticket system.
We get notified in Slack about incoming chat requests. Additionally the 
oncall support engineer gets a PagerDuty notification during business hours.

If a request is not handled, the chat system sets up email replies so the 
conversation can be handled asynchronously as well.
